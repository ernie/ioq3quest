# libVkLayer_khronos_validation.so

Upstream binary, not built locally. Byte-identical to the `arm64-v8a` build in
Vulkan-ValidationLayers release `vulkan-sdk-1.4.335.0` (published 2025-12-09), confirmed by SHA-256
against the published archive.

```

The binary carries no version string, so that checksum is the only thing tying this file to its
release. Re-derive it if the binary is ever replaced.

To update, take the `arm64-v8a` library from a newer release archive; `CMakeLists.txt` copies it into
`jniLibs` as part of the `FULL_BUILD` target.

## Why it ships

The layer is inert in normal play. It loads only when someone with adb enables Android's GPU debug
layers, which the release manifest permits via `com.android.graphics.injectLayers.enable`, so a
validation capture measures the binaries that actually ship.
